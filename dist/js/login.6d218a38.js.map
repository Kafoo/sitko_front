The priority of this\n * mode is to stack events together taking up the least amount of space while\n * trying to ensure the content of the event is always visible as well as its\n * start and end. A sibling column has intersecting event content and must be\n * placed beside each other. Non-sibling columns are offset by 5% from the\n * previous column. The width is scaled by 1.7 so the events overlap and\n * whitespace is reduced. If there is a hole in columns the event width is\n * scaled up so it intersects with the next column. The columns have equal\n * width in the space they are given. If the event doesn't have any to the\n * right of it that intersect with it's content it's right side is extended\n * to the right side.\n */\n\nexport const stack: CalendarEventOverlapMode = (events, firstWeekday, overlapThreshold) => {\n  const handler = getOverlapGroupHandler(firstWeekday)\n\n  // eslint-disable-next-line max-statements\n  return (day, dayEvents, timed, reset) => {\n    if (!timed) {\n      return handler.getVisuals(day, dayEvents, timed, reset)\n    }\n\n    const dayStart = getTimestampIdentifier(day)\n    const visuals = getVisuals(dayEvents, dayStart)\n    const groups = getGroups(visuals, dayStart)\n\n    for (const group of groups) {\n      const nodes: Node[] = []\n\n      for (const visual of group.visuals) {\n        const child = getNode(visual, dayStart)\n        const index = getNextIndex(child, nodes)\n\n        if (index === false) {\n          const parent = getParent(child, nodes)\n          if (parent) {\n            child.parent = parent\n            child.sibling = hasOverlap(child.start, child.end, parent.start, addTime(parent.start, overlapThreshold))\n            child.index = parent.index + 1\n            parent.children.push(child)\n          }\n        } else {\n          const [parent] = getOverlappingRange(child, nodes, index - 1, index - 1)\n          const children = getOverlappingRange(child, nodes, index + 1, index + nodes.length, true)\n\n          child.children = children\n          child.index = index\n\n          if (parent) {\n            child.parent = parent\n            child.sibling = hasOverlap(child.start, child.end, parent.start, addTime(parent.start, overlapThreshold))\n            parent.children.push(child)\n          }\n\n          for (const grand of children) {\n            if (grand.parent === parent) {\n              grand.parent = child\n            }\n\n            const grandNext = grand.index - child.index <= 1\n            if (grandNext && child.sibling &&\n              hasOverlap(child.start, addTime(child.start, overlapThreshold), grand.start, grand.end)) {\n              grand.sibling = true\n            }\n          }\n        }\n\n        nodes.push(child)\n      }\n\n      calculateBounds(nodes, overlapThreshold)\n    }\n\n    visuals.sort((a, b) => (a.left - b.left) || (a.event.startTimestampIdentifier - b.event.startTimestampIdentifier))\n\n    return visuals\n  }\n}\n\nfunction calculateBounds (nodes: Node[], overlapThreshold: number) {\n  for (const node of nodes) {\n    const { visual, parent } = node\n    const columns = getMaxChildIndex(node) + 1\n    const spaceLeft = parent ? parent.visual.left : 0\n    const spaceWidth = FULL_WIDTH - spaceLeft\n    const offset = Math.min(DEFAULT_OFFSET, FULL_WIDTH / columns)\n    const columnWidthMultiplier = getColumnWidthMultiplier(node, nodes)\n    const columnOffset = spaceWidth / (columns - node.index + 1)\n    const columnWidth = spaceWidth / (columns - node.index + (node.sibling ? 1 : 0)) * columnWidthMultiplier\n\n    if (parent) {\n      visual.left = node.sibling\n        ? spaceLeft + columnOffset\n        : spaceLeft + offset\n    }\n\n    visual.width = hasFullWidth(node, nodes, overlapThreshold)\n      ?
